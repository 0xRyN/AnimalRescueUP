# Pet Rescue Saga UP

Compilation instructions : 

Main class is in Controlleur/Lanceur.java

You need to put both custom levels partie_01.txt and partie_02.txt in the root folder of the project (depends on the IDE).

On certain versions of Mac there could be a color problem on compilation, it is fixed by putting these lines in CaseGraphique.java's constructor
this.setOpaque(true);
this.setBorderPainted(false);
